    // What is it that this function is doing? What does it want to do?
    // I think that the approach here is to make something.
    // You want a function that takes a reference to a `operational_state_machine`
    // you could always make it as a m,
    // This was an ugly function when you created it and it is an ugly function now.
    // What should be done?
    // TODO [ ]
    // This is defined on a single operational_solution. Stick with
    // that! I do not think that there is a better way of doing things.
